# A folder in which Django stores scripts that update the database to align with 
# changes to the models. Django's migration tools then apply the necessary changes 
# to any previous version of the database so that it matches the current models. 
# Using migrations, you keep your focus on your models and let Django handle 
# the underlying database schema. Migrations are discussed in the Django documentation; 
# for now, the folder simply contains an __init__.py file (indicating that the folder defines 
# its own Python package).
